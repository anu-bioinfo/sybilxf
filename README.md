# sybilxf
R package for metabolic modeling of Seahorse extracellular flux (XF) data. Used in the publication "Integrating Extracellular Flux Measurements and Genome-Scale Modeling Reveals Differences between Brown and White Adipocytes" (2017) by AK Ramirez, ..., JM Dreyfuss (http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(17)31717-5). To accommodate additional models, Seahorse assays, and integration methods, this package is under active development.

The package is on GitHub, so you can install it with `devtools`:
```
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
install_github("jdreyf/sybilxf")
```
See the vignette for a tutorial.
