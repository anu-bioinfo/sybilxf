\title{Map the seahorse fluxes to metabolic reactions}
\usage{
map_seahorse(x, model.nm = c("2.1A", "2.1x", "2.2"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix of sampled seahorse measurements}

\item{model.nm}{The metabolic model name. One of "2.1A", "2.1x", or "2.2".}
}
\description{
This function takes the matrix of sampled seahorse measurements returned by \code{\link{sample_seahorse}}
and maps the fluxes to metabolic reactions. It returns a matrix with the mapped fluxes of
basal oxygen consumption, mitochondrial oxygen consumption, mitochondrial ATP production,
mitochondrial ATP leak, and basal extracellular acidification
